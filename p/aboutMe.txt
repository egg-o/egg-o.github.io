My name is Sharon and I'm a junior at Cal studying Data Science with an interest in 3D Rigging and Game Dev. I grew up in New York playing Skyrim and Stardew Valley.

While my background is rooted in programming, I've always wanted to create something visually creative. I made small games during college and was introduced to Tech Art my sophomore year. Since then have I continued improving my skills in Character Rigging and Maya.

As of late, I've been working on learning to make Maya tools in Python. Currently I'm working on automating builting a ribbon deformer joint chain. During the summer, I've been working at Blizzard Entertainment as a Character Rigging Intern on Diablo IV, doing skinning and cloth physics.
